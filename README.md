# Side-Channel Attacks (SCA)
* An attacker analyzes power or electromagnetic (EM) signals of a target (microcontroller or FPGA) when it runs encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) and recovers encryption keys.
* Why? Power consumption is correlated with the value processed by the target.
* 0x00 requires less power than 0xFF

# Deep-Learning SCA
* Advantages: no need to pre-process traces, and can defeat existing countermeasures (masking and random delays)
* High accuracy (>90%) in the same-device setting (meaning, train with device A, test with device A).

# Problem
* Poor performace (<10% accuracy or failure to recover keys) in cross-device settting) 
* Train with device A, test with device B.
* Challenges:  
  * Limited traces from device B
  * Unknown ket from device B
  * Complex discrepancies caused by hardware and software
 
 # Objectives
 * Task 1: Collect EM traces on microcontrollers and test results with our existing ML code.
 * Task 2: Study instruction rewriting in assembly on AVR XMEGA and ARM STM32 as well as examine the impact of instructions rewriting in deep learning side channel attacks.
 * Task 3: Collect EM traces of AES encryption compiled with different optimizations and study the optimizationsâ€™ effects.

# EM Data Collection Process
* Collect 8 50k EM datasets
  * XMEGA unmasked PC1 and PC2
  * XMEGA masked PC1 and PC2
  * STM32 unmasked PC1 and PC2
  * STM32 masked PC1 and PC2
* Perform Normal Inter-Class Variance (NICV) to identify and locate leakage within a defined attack window.
  * ```code/analysis/NICV/```
* Perform Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
  * ```code/analysis/SNR/```
* Run CPA attack to recover keys
  * ```code/analysis/CPA/```
* Train and test data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  * ```code/analysis/CNN/```
  * Firstly, train and test in the same-device scenario.
  * Move on to cross-device after completion. 
  * For both scenarios, use 40k for training and 10k for testing

  * Train:
    * python train.py --input path_to_dataset --output path_to_save_the_model --verbose --target_byte TARGET_BYTE --network_type choose_network_type{hw_model,mlp,cnn2,wang,cnn} --attack_window ATTACK_WINDOW
  * Test:
    * python test.py --input path_to_dataset --output path_to_save_the_test_results --model_file MODEL_FILE --verbose --target_byte TARGET_BYTE --network_type choose_network_type{wang,cnn2,cnn,mlp} --attack_window ATTACK_WINDOW



# Power Trace Data Collection Process
* Compile rewritten AES encryption code and load onto XMEGA target
  * ```code/instruction_rewriting/XMEGA/``` 
* Collect 2 50k Power datasets
  * XMEGA masked PC2
  * XMEGA rewritten PC2
* Perform Normal Inter-Class Variance (NICV) to identify and locate leakage within a defined attack window.
  * ```code/analysis/NICV/```
* Perform Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
  * ```code/analysis/SNR/```
* Run CPA attack to recover keys
  * ```code/analysis/CPA/```
* Train and test data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  * ```code/analysis/CNN/```
  * Firstly, train and test masked AES in the same-software scenario.
  * Move on to test rewritten AES 
  * For both scenarios, use 40k for training and 10k for testing
  * Test original masked AES attack window and adjusted attack window based on NICV results
